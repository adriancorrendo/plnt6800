Parameters are fixed, and randomness comes from data variation. It's called \"frequentism\" because it relies on the frequency of events under repeated sampling.\n\n> 🎲 **Example:** To estimate the probability of rolling a 6, Frequentists say: “If we roll a die infinitely many times, the proportion of 6s will approach 1/6.”\n\nInference is based on idealized, repeated experiments — even ones we've never performed.\n\nIn contrast, Bayesianism does *not* assume a fixed truth. It centers on:\n\n**PROBABILITIES:** All knowledge is probabilistic — not true/false, but likely/unlikely.\n\n**BELIEFS:** Prior knowledge is incorporated into analysis via prior distributions. Even when we know nothing (👉 uninformative priors!), Bayesianism lets us model uncertainty.\n\n> 🎲 **Bayesian Dice:** “We are *a priori* 16.7% certain we’ll get a 6.”\n\nBayesian inference updates beliefs based on observed data:\n\n$$\n\\text{Posterior} = \\frac{\\text{Likelihood} \\times \\text{Prior}}{\\text{Evidence}}\n$$\n\nAnd to compare competing models or beliefs, we use the **Bayes Factor**:\n\n$$\n\\text{Bayes Factor} = \\frac{\\text{Posterior}}{\\text{Prior}} = \\frac{0.334}{0.167} = 2\n$$\n\nThis means the updated belief is twice as likely, given the data.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Frequentism**: Models are fixed; randomness is in the data.\n- **Bayesianism**: After being observed, the data is considered fixed; uncertainty lies in the model (parameters and predictions).\n\n::: callout-tip\nFor many simple models, both approaches yield similar conclusions.\n\n💡 Hint: Consider uninformative priors!\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\nBayesian logic mirrors human reasoning:\n\n1. We collect data.\n2. We have prior beliefs.\n3. We combine both to update our beliefs.\n:::\n\n## Bayes Theorem\n\n$$\nP(A_{\\text{true}} \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A_{\\text{true}}) \\cdot P(A_{\\text{true}})}{P(B)}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{Posterior} = \\frac{\\text{Likelihood} \\times \\text{Prior}}{\\text{Evidence}}\n$$\n\n### Video: Bayes' Rule\n\n::: {align=\"center\"}\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HZGCoVF3YvM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n:::\n\n## The Priors\n\nPriors formalize our beliefs as probability distributions — based on:\n\n1. The nature of the variable (discrete/continuous)\n2. Our prior knowledge or lack thereof\n\n::: callout-tip\n🧠 **Bayesian Perspective on Uncertainty**\n\nIn Bayesian analysis, uncertainty is placed on:\n\n- **Parameters** (they are random variables with prior/posterior distributions)\n- **Predictions** (future outcomes are modeled probabilistically)\n\nOnce data is observed, it's considered fixed.\n\nSo rather than saying \"data is fixed, model is random,\" it's more precise to say:\n\n> \"Bayesian analysis treats unknown parameters and future data as random variables, while the observed data is fixed. The uncertainty lies in our beliefs about parameters and predictions, not in the data we’ve already seen.\"\n\n:::\n\n## 📈 Visualization of Bayesian Updating\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 300)\nprior <- exp(-((x - 0.3)^2) / 0.05)\nlikelihood <- exp(-((x - 0.7)^2) / 0.02)\nposterior <- exp(-((x - 0.6)^2) / 0.01)\n\n# Normalize\nprior <- prior / sum(prior)\nlikelihood <- likelihood / sum(likelihood)\nposterior <- posterior / sum(posterior)\n\ndf <- data.frame(x = x, Prior = prior, Likelihood = likelihood, Posterior = posterior)\n\ndf_long <- df %>% pivot_longer(cols = -x, names_to = \"Distribution\", values_to = \"Density\")\n\nggplot(df_long, aes(x = x, y = Density, color = Distribution)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Bayesian Updating: Prior × Likelihood → Posterior\",\n       x = \"Parameter (\\u03B8)\", y = \"Density\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"tomato\", \"steelblue\", \"darkgreen\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fig 1.
