## 🎓 Why talk about data protection in a coding class?

When we learn coding, we often focus on *how* to analyze data. But in real projects, the hardest (and most important) questions are often:

- Should we collect/share this data at all?
- Who could be harmed if it’s misused?
- How do we make data useful without losing trust or violating rights?

Good data management protects three things:

1. **Privacy** 🔒 — preventing inappropriate exposure of personal or sensitive information  
2. **Integrity** ✅ — ensuring data aren’t altered, corrupted, or misrepresented  
3. **Value** 💡 — making data understandable and reusable so it can support learning, decisions, and research

## ✨ FAIR principles 

**FAIR** is about making data (and metadata) *easy to discover and reuse*—by both people and computers.

- **Findable:** others can locate the dataset (titles, keywords, metadata, persistent links)
- **Accessible:** it can be retrieved in a controlled way (open when possible, restricted when needed)
- **Interoperable:** it uses standard formats and vocabularies so tools can combine it with other data
- **Reusable:** it includes enough context (methods, units, codes, license) to be reused correctly

::: {.callout-note}
### ✅ Key idea
**FAIR does *not* mean “open.”**  
Data can be restricted and still be FAIR if it is well-described and the access conditions are clear.
:::

## 🌿 CARE principles

**CARE** focuses on the *people and communities behind data*, especially when data relate to **Indigenous Peoples** and Indigenous Knowledge.

- **Collective benefit:** data use should support community wellbeing (not just outside interests)
- **Authority to control:** communities have rights and interests in how data are collected, accessed, and used
- **Responsibility:** users of data must be accountable and support respectful relationships
- **Ethics:** data use should minimize harm and align with community values and consent

::: {.callout-important}
### 🧭 Key idea
CARE emphasizes **rights, power, relationships, and purpose**—not just technical usability.

## 🧩 FAIR + CARE together

FAIR and CARE answer different questions:

- **FAIR asks:** *Can this dataset be found and reused properly?*
- **CARE asks:** *Should it be used this way, and who benefits or could be harmed?*

They complement each other:

- You can make data technically reusable (**FAIR**) while still respecting rights, consent, and community governance (**CARE**).
- A dataset can be well-organized but still inappropriate to share if it ignores authority, consent, or potential harm.

::: {.callout-tip}
### ⭐ Takeaway
**FAIR improves reusability. CARE protects people and communities.**  
Strong data practice needs both.

## ✅ Practical checklist for student projects

Use this before sharing data, code, or a repository.

### 🔒 1) Privacy & sensitivity
- Does the dataset include personal, confidential, location-based, or culturally sensitive information?
- Have you removed identifiers (when appropriate) and documented what was removed?
- Are access rules clear (open vs restricted)?

::: {.callout-warning}
### ⚠️ Caution
Even if you remove names, **small datasets + detailed locations + rare characteristics** can still identify people or communities.
:::

### ✅ 2) Integrity & trust
- Do you track versions of files (e.g., Git commits, file naming, or release tags)?
- Can someone reproduce your results from your code + data description?
- Did you document cleaning steps and assumptions?

### ✨ 3) FAIR basics
- Is there a clear `README` describing what the dataset is and how to use it?
- Are variables explained (a data dictionary)?
- Are formats standard (e.g., `.csv`, consistent units, consistent column names)?
- Is there a license or clear re-use statement?

### 🌿 4) CARE basics
- Who does the data describe, and who should have a say in how it is used?
- Does the project involve Indigenous data or knowledge?
- Do you have permission/consent and the right governance process for use and sharing?
- Can you explain who benefits from this work and how potential harms are reduced?

## 🏁 In a nutshell

* **FAIR helps others use data well.**  <br/>
* **CARE helps ensure data use is right and respectful.**   <br/>
* Together, they help protect **privacy**, **integrity**, and the **value** of data. 🛡️

## 🗣️To think about...

Pick one scenario:

1. A dataset contains farm trial results with GPS coordinates  
2. A dataset includes survey responses from a small community  
3. A dataset includes information related to Indigenous lands, communities, or knowledge  

Consider the following questions:
- What could go wrong if the data are shared publicly?
- What would you do to make the project more FAIR?
- What CARE questions should be asked before publishing?

::: {.callout-note}
### 🧠 Optional prompt
Write a 3–4 sentence “sharing decision” for your scenario: <br/>
- **What will be shared?** <br/>
- **What will be restricted (and why)?**  <br/>
- **How will you document access conditions and responsibilities?**  <br/>
