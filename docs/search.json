It is one of the most commonly used data structures in R for data analysis and manipulation. \nKey Characteristics of a Data Frame \n\nTabular Structure: Data is organized in rows and columns. \nHeterogeneous Columns: Each column can contain different data types (e.g., numeric, character, logical), but all elements in a column must be of the same type. \nRow and Column Names: Rows and columns can have names for easier identification. \n\nWhy Use a Data Frame? \n\nData Analysis: It is ideal for representing structured data like spreadsheets or databases. \nFlexible Operations: Columns can be easily added, removed, or modified. \nIntegration with R Functions: Many R functions for statistical modeling and analysis expect data frames as input. \n\n\na. Creating a Data Frame\nA data frame can be created using the data.frame() function:\n\n# Create a data frame\nmy_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  Crop = c(\"Corn\", \"Wheat\", \"Soybean\"), # Character column\n  Yield = c(180, 90, 50), # Numeric column\n  Legume = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE) # Logical column\n)\n\nprint(my_data)\n\n     Crop Yield Legume\n1    Corn   180  FALSE\n2   Wheat    90  FALSE\n3 Soybean    50   TRUE\n\n\n\n\nb.

Selecting (columns)\nIn base R, there is no function to select columns.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe dplyr package in R provides powerful tools for transforming and analyzing data. In this tutorial, we’ll use an agricultural dataset to explore some common dplyr functions like filter(), mutate(), summarize(), and group_by().\nWe’ll use the agridat package for our dataset. If you don’t have it installed, you can do so by running:\n\ninstall.packages(\"agridat\")\n\n\n\nExample Dataset: Corn Yields\nFor this tutorial, we’ll use the lasrosas.corn dataset, which contains information on corn varieties, yields, and topographical features. First, let’s load the required packages and inspect the dataset:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(agridat)\n\n# Load dataset\ndata(\"lasrosas.corn\")\ncorn_data &lt;- lasrosas.corn\n\n# Inspect the dataset\nglimpse(corn_data)\n\nRows: 3,443\nColumns: 9\n$ year  &lt;int&gt; 1999, 1999, 1999, 1999, 1999, 1999, 1999, 1999, 1999, 1999, 1999…\n$ lat   &lt;dbl&gt; -33.05113, -33.05115, -33.05116, -33.05117, -33.05118, -33.05120…\n$ long  &lt;dbl&gt; -63.84886, -63.84879, -63.84872, -63.84865, -63.84858, -63.84851…\n$ yield &lt;dbl&gt; 72.14, 73.79, 77.25, 76.35, 75.55, 70.24, 76.17, 69.17, 69.77, 6…\n$ nitro &lt;dbl&gt; 131.5, 131.5, 131.5, 131.5, 131.5, 131.5, 131.5, 131.5, 131.5, 1…\n$ topo  &lt;fct&gt; W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W…\n$ bv    &lt;dbl&gt; 162.60, 170.49, 168.39, 176.68, 171.46, 170.56, 172.94, 171.86, …\n$ rep   &lt;fct&gt; R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, …\n$ nf    &lt;fct&gt; N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, …\n\n\nThe glimpse() function provides an overview of the dataset, including variable names and data types.\n\n\nFiltering Data\nTo focus on specific data, we can use filter(). For example, let’s filter the data to include only rows where the nitrogen applied (nitro) is greater than 100:\n\n# Filter rows with nitro &gt; 100\nhigh_nitro &lt;- corn_data %&gt;% filter(nitro &gt; 100)\nhead(high_nitro)\n\n  year       lat      long yield nitro topo     bv rep nf\n1 1999 -33.05113 -63.84886 72.14 131.5    W 162.60  R1 N5\n2 1999 -33.05115 -63.84879 73.79 131.5    W 170.49  R1 N5\n3 1999 -33.05116 -63.84872 77.25 131.5    W 168.39  R1 N5\n4 1999 -33.05117 -63.84865 76.35 131.5    W 176.68  R1 N5\n5 1999 -33.05118 -63.84858 75.55 131.5    W 171.46  R1 N5\n6 1999 -33.05120 -63.84851 70.24 131.5    W 170.56  R1 N5\n\n\nThis selects only rows where the nitro column has values greater than 100.\n\n\nAdding New Variables with mutate()\nYou can add new columns to your dataset with mutate(). Let’s calculate the yield in tons per hectare (assuming the current yield is in kilograms):\n\n# Add a column for yield in tons\ncorn_data &lt;- corn_data %&gt;% mutate(yield_tons = yield / 1000)\nhead(corn_data)\n\n  year       lat      long yield nitro topo     bv rep nf yield_tons\n1 1999 -33.05113 -63.84886 72.14 131.5    W 162.60  R1 N5    0.07214\n2 1999 -33.05115 -63.84879 73.79 131.5    W 170.49  R1 N5    0.07379\n3 1999 -33.05116 -63.84872 77.25 131.5    W 168.39  R1 N5    0.07725\n4 1999 -33.05117 -63.84865 76.35 131.5    W 176.68  R1 N5    0.07635\n5 1999 -33.05118 -63.84858 75.55 131.5    W 171.46  R1 N5    0.07555\n6 1999 -33.05120 -63.84851 70.24 131.5    W 170.56  R1 N5    0.07024\n\n\nThis creates a new column, yield_tons, with the transformed yield values.\n\n\nSummarizing Data\nTo get a quick overview of your data, you can use summarize() in combination with group_by(). For example, let’s calculate the average yield for each topographical category (topo):\n\n# Average yield by topography\naverage_yield_topo &lt;- corn_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(topo) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg_yield = mean(yield, na.rm = TRUE))\naverage_yield_topo\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  topo  avg_yield\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 E          78.7\n2 HT         48.6\n3 LO         84.9\n4 W          66.8\n\n# Average yield by year and topography\naverage_yield_topoyear &lt;- corn_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, topo) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg_yield = mean(yield, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\naverage_yield_topoyear\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n# Groups:   year [2]\n   year topo  avg_yield\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  1999 E          64.8\n2  1999 HT         53.4\n3  1999 LO         71.2\n4  1999 W          66.0\n5  2001 E          92.7\n6  2001 HT         44.7\n7  2001 LO         99.9\n8  2001 W          67.7\n\n\nThis groups the data by topo and calculates the mean yield for each group.\n\n\nAdditional dplyr Functions\nHere are some other useful dplyr functions:\n\narrange(): Arrange rows by a variable in ascending or descending order.\n\n# Arrange data by yield in descending order\narranged_data &lt;- corn_data %&gt;% arrange(desc(yield))\nhead(arranged_data)\n\n  year       lat      long  yield nitro topo     bv rep nf yield_tons\n1 2001 -33.05086 -63.84317 117.90  99.8   LO 162.17  R3 N4    0.11790\n2 2001 -33.05125 -63.84245 117.19 124.6   LO 165.81  R3 N5    0.11719\n3 2001 -33.05181 -63.84323 116.64 124.6   LO 159.75  R1 N5    0.11664\n4 2001 -33.05084 -63.84324 114.94  99.8   LO 166.27  R3 N4    0.11494\n5 2001 -33.05134 -63.84299 114.46  99.8   LO 164.58  R2 N4    0.11446\n6 2001 -33.05127 -63.84238 114.08 124.6   LO 170.94  R3 N5    0.11408\n\n\nselect(): Select specific columns from the dataset.\n\n# Select specific columns\nselected_data &lt;- corn_data %&gt;% select(yield, nitro, topo)\nhead(selected_data)\n\n  yield nitro topo\n1 72.14 131.5    W\n2 73.79 131.5    W\n3 77.25 131.5    W\n4 76.35 131.5    W\n5 75.55 131.5    W\n6 70.24 131.5    W\n\n\ndistinct(): Find unique values in a column.\n\n# Unique values in topo\nunique_topo &lt;- corn_data %&gt;% distinct(topo)\nunique_topo\n\n  topo\n1    W\n2   HT\n3    E\n4   LO\n\n\ncount(): Count the number of observations in each group.\n\n# Count observations by topo\ntopo_count &lt;- corn_data %&gt;% count(topo)\ntopo_count\n\n  topo    n\n1    E  730\n2   HT  785\n3   LO  885\n4    W 1043\n\n\nrename(): Rename a column.\n\n# Rename a column\nrenamed_data &lt;- corn_data %&gt;% rename(Nitrogen = nitro)\nhead(renamed_data)\n\n  year       lat      long yield Nitrogen topo     bv rep nf yield_tons\n1 1999 -33.05113 -63.84886 72.14    131.5    W 162.60  R1 N5    0.07214\n2 1999 -33.05115 -63.84879 73.79    131.5    W 170.49  R1 N5    0.07379\n3 1999 -33.05116 -63.84872 77.25    131.5    W 168.39  R1 N5    0.07725\n4 1999 -33.05117 -63.84865 76.35    131.5    W 176.68  R1 N5    0.07635\n5 1999 -33.05118 -63.84858 75.55    131.5    W 171.46  R1 N5    0.07555\n6 1999 -33.05120 -63.84851 70.24    131.5    W 170.56  R1 N5    0.07024\n\n\n\n\n\nHands-On Exercise\nTry the following tasks using the lasrosas.corn dataset:\n\nFilter the data to include only rows where the yield is greater than 6000.\nAdd a new column that calculates yield per kilogram of nitrogen applied.\nSummarize the data to find the total yield for each topo category.\nArrange the data by nitro in ascending order.\nUse select() to create a dataset with only the yield, topo, and nitro columns.\n\nSubmit your code and results to the class discussion forum. Happy coding!\n\n\nConclusion\nThe dplyr package simplifies data transformation and analysis tasks, making it easier to work with agricultural datasets like the one in this tutorial. Use these functions and try the hands-on exercise to deepen your understanding.\nHappy coding!"
