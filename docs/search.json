This course emphasizes reproducibility in data analysis, ensuring that results can be consistently replicated. Students will learn essential data science concepts, and how to use functions, packages, and version control to effectively manage their data and collaborate with peers. Following tidy principles, the course promotes best coding practices for data wrangling, effective visualization, and clean deployment of statistical models common in agriculture. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to handle a variety of agricultural datasets and produce reliable, reproducible research outcomes.\n\nPrerequisite(s)\nA basic understanding of R or any programming language is recommended but not required. Basic statistical theory is also recommended.\n\n\nTextbooks and Resources\nRecommended:\n\nR for Data Science by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund.\nOnline resources and package documentation will be provided throughout the course.",

Data Usage Policy for the Semester Project\nStudents are encouraged to use data from their own research projects for the semester project. However, it is essential to ensure the integrity and privacy of the data, as well as compliance with the policies of their research lab or institution. To safeguard data privacy and integrity:¬†\n\nData Sharing Restrictions: Students are NOT allowed to upload raw research data directly to the instructor, peers, GitHub repositories, Posit Cloud, or any other external platform.\nDe-Identification and Transformation: Before using or sharing the data for the semester project, students must de-identify and transform the data as necessary. This process should ensure that sensitive information or identifying details are removed or anonymized. All data preparation must be performed locally on the student‚Äôs machine before incorporating it into the project.¬†\nDocumentation Requirement: Students must include a clear description of the steps taken to de-identify and transform the data in their project report or presentation. This demonstrates adherence to ethical data handling practices.\n\nBy following these guidelines, students can apply their learning to real-world datasets while respecting ethical and institutional standards. The instructor is not responsible for students‚Äô violations to the integrity and privacy of their research data. Non-compliance with this policy may result in disqualification of the project or additional academic consequences.",
