## [![DPAG-OAC-UOG](images/uog.png)](https://www.plant.uoguelph.ca)Welcome!

Reproducible Ag Data Science with R is the first edition Ag data science course designed by Dr. Adrian Correndo offered at Department of Plant Agriculture (University of Guelph) for graduate students in crop and soil sciences to develop key skills in data science using R. This course emphasizes reproducibility in data analysis, ensuring that results can be consistently replicated. Students will learn essential data science concepts, and how to use functions, packages, and version control to effectively manage their data and collaborate with peers. Following tidy principles, the course promotes best coding practices for data wrangling, effective visualization, and clean deployment of statistical models common in agriculture. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to handle a variety of agricultural datasets and produce reliable, reproducible research outcomes.

### Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1.  Understand and apply the principles of reproducible research in data science.

2.  Use version control tools like GitHub for managing code and collaborative projects.

3.  Develop proficiency in R, including data wrangling, data visualization, and the use of relevant packages for agricultural datasets.

4.  Apply statistical models to agricultural data and interpret the results.

5.  Produce professional reports using RMarkdown and Quarto, ensuring reproducibility and clarity.

### Course Technology Requirements

This course will use a variety of technologies and resources. To successfully participate in and complete this course, students will need access to the following

#### **1. Communication tools:**

**CourseLink**. This platform will be used as the main Course-Home Page. If you need any assistance with the software tools or the CourseLink website, contact CourseLink Support. Email: courselink\@uoguelph.ca Tel: 519-824-4120 ext. 56939 Toll-Free (CAN/USA): 1-866- 275-1478. Support Hours (Eastern Time): Monday thru Friday: 8:30 am–8:30 pm; Saturday: 10:00 am–4:00 pm; Sunday: 12:00 pm–6:00 pm

**Zoom**. This course will use Zoom for lectures when in-person class is not possible. Check your system requirements to ensure you will be able to participate (https://opened.uoguelph.ca/student-resources/system-and-software-requirements/). A Zoom link for the class will be provided before the first day of class. Please, check Home-Page and announcements on CourseLink, and emails from the instructor (acorrend\@uoguelph.ca).

#### **2. Software & Tools:**

-   **R** (latest stable version, available at CRAN).

-   **RStudio/Posit IDE** (desktop or cloud-based version for writing and running R code).

-   **Course-Specific Libraries and Packages**: Students will be required to install R packages. Detailed instructions will be provided in class.

-   **Version Control and Collaboration Tools**: **Git** (for version control) and a free **GitHub** account for collaborative project work and sharing code.

#### **3. Computing Requirements:**

A laptop or desktop computer capable of running R and RStudio (Windows, MacOS, or Linux). Minimum specifications include:

-   **Processor**: At least a dual-core processor.

-   **RAM**: 8 GB or more (16 GB recommended for handling larger datasets).

-   **Storage**: 10 GB of free space for software installation, course files, and datasets.

#### **4. Internet Access:**

Reliable high-speed internet for accessing online sessions, resources, downloading software, and using cloud-based platforms (e.g., Posit Cloud, GitHub).
