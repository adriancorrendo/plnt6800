## 2. Course Description

Reproducible Ag Data Science with R is designed for graduate students in crop and soil sciences to develop key skills in data science using R. This course emphasizes reproducibility in data analysis, ensuring that results can be consistently replicated. Students will learn essential data science concepts, and how to use functions, packages, and version control to effectively manage their data and collaborate with peers. Following tidy principles, the course promotes best coding practices for data wrangling, effective visualization, and clean deployment of statistical models common in agriculture. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to handle a variety of agricultural datasets and produce reliable, reproducible research outcomes.

### Prerequisite(s)

A basic understanding of R or any programming language is recommended but not required. Basic statistical theory is also recommended.

### Textbooks and Resources

**Recommended:**

### b. Use of Devices

Electronic recording of classes is forbidden without prior permission from the instructor.

### c. Academic honesty

Please adhere to the following guidelines when working on assignments for this course:

-   **Individual and Team Assignments**: You are welcome to discuss individual homework and lab assignments with other students; however, direct sharing or copying of code or written work is not permitted. For team assignments, collaboration is allowed freely within your team. Sharing or copying code or written content between teams is prohibited. Any unauthorized sharing or copying will be treated as a violation for all parties involved.

-   **Exams**: Collaboration or discussion with others during exams is strictly prohibited. Unauthorized collaboration or use of unapproved materials will be considered a violation for all students involved.

-   **Reusing Code**: Unless specified otherwise, you may refer to online resources (e.g., StackOverflow) for coding examples in assignments. If you use code from an external source directly or take inspiration from it, you must clearly cite the source. The use of AI to complete tasks is not prohibited but it must be disclosed. Failure to cite reused code will be considered plagiarism.

**C. Data Usage Policy for the Semester Project**

Students are encouraged to use data from their own research projects for the semester project. However, it is essential to ensure the integrity and privacy of the data, as well as compliance with the policies of their research lab or institution. To safeguard data privacy and integrity: 

1.  **Data Sharing Restrictions**: Students are **NOT allowed** to upload raw research data directly to the instructor, peers, GitHub repositories, Posit Cloud, or any other external platform.

2.  **De-Identification and Transformation**: Before using or sharing the data for the semester project, students **must de-identify and transform the data** as necessary. This process should ensure that sensitive information or identifying details are removed or anonymized. All data preparation must be performed locally on the student’s machine before incorporating it into the project. 

3.  **Documentation Requirement**: Students must include a clear description of the steps taken to de-identify and transform the data in their project report or presentation. This demonstrates adherence to ethical data handling practices.

By following these guidelines, students can apply their learning to real-world datasets while respecting ethical and institutional standards. The instructor is not responsible for students' violations to the integrity and privacy of their research data. Non-compliance with this policy may result in disqualification of the project or additional academic consequences.

## 8. Accessibility

Students requiring accommodations must register with Student Accessibility Services. Contact the instructor early in the semester to arrange accommodations.

## 9. Land Acknowledgement

The University of Guelph resides on the ancestral lands of the Attawandaron people and the treaty lands and territory of the Mississaugas of the Credit. We recognize the significance of the Dish with One Spoon Covenant to this land and offer respect to our Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, and Métis neighbours. Today, this gathering place is home to many First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples, and acknowledging them reminds us of our important connection to this land where we work and learn.
