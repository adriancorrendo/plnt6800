# 1. How this course works

## Learning Goals 📌

1. **Reproducibility**: understand the principles and importance of reproducible data analysis.

2. **Data manipulation**: develop proficiency in R, including key data structures, packages, and functions to read, clean, transform, and organize datasets.

3. **Data visualization**: create informative and aesthetically pleasing visualizations of data.

4. **Modelling and iteration**: apply various algorithms and statistical models common to plant agriculture, and implement techniques to handle multiple datasets simultaneously.

5. **Professional reporting**: produce professional reports for sharing results.

6. **Version control**: manage the basics of Git and Github for collaborative projects.

## A hands-on learning model

-   **Live coding sessions** (you code along with me)
-   Focus on **doing**, not just reading about tools
-   Class time is for:
    -   building workflows
    -   troubleshooting together
    -   practicing reproducible habits

## What you’ll leave with

-   The ability to complete a reproducible analysis workflow
-   An understanding of main models used in agriculture data science
-   Confidence reading/writing **Quarto** (`.qmd`) documents
-   A lot of templates to re-use in the future
-   A portfolio-ready project

:::

-   Is there a REPRODUCIBILITY CRISIS in science?

-   YES

-   A [Nature survey](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a) with \~1,600 researchers found that

    -   ***+70%*** failure rate to reproduce another scientist's experiments

    -   ***+50%*** have failed to reproduce their own experiments

    -   ***Main causes***: selective reporting, weak stats, code/data unavailability, etc.

## **Why Reproducibility in Agriculture?**

-   Agriculture research relies heavily on environmental data, often variable and complex.

-   **We have complex challenges** 🗒️

    -   Variability due to environmental factors, soil types, and weather patterns.
    -   Complex datasets involving long-term studies, geographical variability.

-   **Opportunities** ✅

    -   Reproducibility helps stakeholders make reliable, data-driven decisions.
    -   Ensures scientific findings are reliable and valid.
    -   Facilitates collaboration, accountability, and efficiency among researchers and practitioners.
